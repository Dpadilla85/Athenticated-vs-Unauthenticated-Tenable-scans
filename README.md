# Athenticated-vs-Unauthenticated-Tenable-scans

This project compares the results of **unauthenticated** and **authenticated** vulnerability scans performed on a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Tenable using Azure.  
It demonstrates the critical importance of using authenticated scans to reveal deeper system vulnerabilities.

---

## ⚙️ Technology Utilized
- **Tenable.io** – Vulnerability scanning and management platform.
- **Azure Virtual Machines** – Windows 10 VM for scanning and target testing.
- **Windows Firewall** – Disabled for demonstration of unauthenticated scans.
- **PowerShell** – For VM configuration and environment setup.

## 🔍 Comparison of Scan Results
| Metric                       | Unauthenticated Scan | Authenticated Scan |
|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities     | 0                    | 2                  |
| High Vulnerabilities         | 0                    | 4                  |
| Medium Vulnerabilities       | 6                    | 19                 |
| Low Vulnerabilities          | 1                    | 3                  |
| Info/Low-Level Findings      | 29                   | 136                |
| **Total Vulnerabilities**    | 36                   | 164                |

Authenticated scans provide a more accurate view of system vulnerabilities and should be prioritized in enterprise environments.
